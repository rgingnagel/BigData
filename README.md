# BigData

Welcome! This is the prototype that I build for the University of Amsterdam Big Data Course. 

Instructions: 
Run the prototype.ipynb iPython notebook. The used libraries can be found in the pip-file. 

The used data-sources are too big to upload to Github. They files can be downloaded at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data
